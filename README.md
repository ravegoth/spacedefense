```

## Building

**Windows**
1. Install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
2. Install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
3. Add MinGW and SFML to PATH
4. Edit the run.bat and edit the following line with the location of your g++ compiler and SFML libraries (if you installed them in a different location)
```
C:\mingw64\bin\g++ src/main.cpp -o bin/spacedefense.exe -I "C:\SFML-2.6.1\include" -L "C:\SFML-2.6.1\lib" -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio -lsfml-network -mwindows -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```
5. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravegoth/spacedefense
```
6. Run the following commands:
```bash
cd spacedefense
run
```
**Note:** Sometimes you have to build the SFML libraries yourself. You can find the instructions [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/compile-with-cmake.php)
